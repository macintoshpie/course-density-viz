# Course density visualization  
This is a small visualization project I did in the Winter of 2017. The notebook processes and creates graphs to show departmental course density throughout the Spring semester of 2017 for Furman University.  
For this project I learned the following:  
* Converting dense data to long/sparse data
* Pandas datetime formatting
* Making stacked area plots in matplotlib
* Creating gifs
